# Weather App
Click [here](https://arturmk98.github.io/WeatherApp/) to see the weather app working. It might take a while to load, you also need to allow the website to access your location.

# How it works
- After you click on the link and get redirected to the website, allow the website to access your location.
- Once the website obtains your location information, the name of the region, a simple animation, temperature and a short weather description will show up on the screen.
- You can click on the temperature to change the units between celcius and farenheit

# Future plans
- Fix temperature section so that a farenheit value with decimal points doesn't appear on the screen and instead the temperature in celcius is showed from the beginning.
- Implement a weekly forecast section which will show the weather and a simple animation for each day for 5-7 days
- Possibly add a few more animations or graphics to make the website look a bit more interesting.
- Make the colours of the website change depending on the weather. For example, the colours could change to orange/yellow when it is warm and blue/white when cold
- If possible, make region description more accurate
